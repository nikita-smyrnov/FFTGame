# Final Project
- NOTE: Put all .mp3 or .wav files into the bin/data folder that comes with an OpenFrameworks project by default. If you not, the game will not be able to load the files.
 - This is a rhythm game made by Nikita Smyrnov that does FFT analysis on the song. More information can be found in the project proposal document.
